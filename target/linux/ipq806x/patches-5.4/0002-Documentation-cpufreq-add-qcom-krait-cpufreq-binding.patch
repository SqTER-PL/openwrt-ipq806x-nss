+title: Krait Cpu Frequency Scaling dedicated driver
+
+maintainers:
+  - Ansuel Smith <ansuelsmth@gmail.com>
+
+description: |
+  The krait cpufreq driver is a dedicated frequency scaling driver
+  based on cpufreq-dt generic driver that scale L2 cache and optionally
+  DDR and APPS (if the driver is compiled) on cpu frequency change.
+
+  Cache is scaled with the max frequency across all core and the cache
+  frequency will scale based on the configured threshold in the dts.
+
+  The cache is hardcoded to 3 frequency bin, idle, nominal and high.
+
+properties:
+  compatible:
+    const: qcom,krait-cpufreq
+
+  'l2-rates':
+    description: |
+      Frequency the L2 cache will be scaled at.
+    items:

+      - description: nominal
+      - description: high
+
+  l2-cpufreq:
+    description: |
+      Threshold used by the driver to scale the L2 cache.
+      If the max CPU Frequency is more than the set frequency,
+      the driver will transition to the next frequency bin.
+    items:
+      - description: idle
+      - description: nominal
+      - description: high
+
+  l2-volt:
+    description: |
+      Threshold used by the driver to scale the L2 cache.
+      If the max CPU Frequency is more than the set frequency,
+      the driver will transition to the next frequency bin.
